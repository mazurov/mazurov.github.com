It was found a significant decrease of CPU time (from 4% to 6%) if use tcmalloc's function instead
of standard "new" operator. Result was acquired from running 2 jobs: job for 3 
lines (DiMuonHighMass, DiMuonLowMass, AllL0) and for single line (DiMuonHighMass). 
10000 events were processed.

## 3 lines

* tc_new **2.3** times faster then "new" operator.
* Total improvement:  **4%**.
  (if consider "CPU time" field's value as 100%).
