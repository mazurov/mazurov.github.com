#Example Report

## Terms of Reference

Margaret Anderson, Director of Personnel has requested this report on employee benefits satisfaction. The report was to be submitted to her by 28 June.

## Procedure

A representative selection of 15% of all employees were interviewed in the period between April 1st and April 15th concerning:

* Overall satisfaction with our current benefits package
* Problems encountered when dealing with the personnel department
* Suggestions for the improvement of communication policies
* Problems encountered when dealing with our HMO


## Findings
* Employees were generally satisfied with the current benefits package.
* Some problems were encountered when requesting vacation due to what is perceived as long approval waiting periods.
* Older employees repeatedly had problems with HMO prescription drugs procedures.
* Employees between the ages of 22 and 30 report few problems with HMO.
* Most employees complain about the lack of dental insurance in our benefits package.
* The most common suggestion for improvement was for the ability to process benefits requests online.


## Conclusions

* Older employees, those over 50, are having serious problems with our HMO's ability to provide prescription drugs.
* Our benefits request system needs to be revised as most complaints concerning in-house processing.
* Improvements need to take place in personnel department response time.
* Information technology improvements should be considered as employees become more technologically savvy.


## Recommendations

* Meet with HMO representatives to discuss the serious nature of complaints concerning prescription drug benefits for older employees.
* Give priority to vacation request response time as employees need faster approval in order to be able to plan their vacations.
* Take no special actions for the benefits package of younger employees.
* Discuss the possibility of adding an online benefits requests system to our company Intranet.

# Important Points to Remember
* A report is divided into four areas:
  * Terms of Reference - This section gives background information on the reason for the report. It usually includes the person requesting the report.
  * Procedure - The procedure provides the exact steps taken and methods used for the report.
  * Findings - The findings point out discoveries made during the course of the report investigation.
  * Conclusions - The conclusions provide logical conclusions based on the findings.
  * Recommendations - The recommendations state actions that the writer of the report feels need to be taken based on the findings and conclusions.
* Reports should be concise and factual. Opinions are given in the "conclusions" section. However, these opinions should be based on facts presented in the "findings".
* Use simple tenses (usually the present simple) to express facts.
* Use the imperative form (Discuss the possibility ..., Give priority ..., etc.) in the "recommendations" section as these apply to the company as a whole.
